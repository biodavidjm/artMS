Changes in version 1.10.3 (2021-07-27)
+ {artmsAnalysisQuantifications()}: remove features with negative abundance values
+ The human annotation library org.Hs.eg.db is not required by artMS with the goal of reducing the size of the package. Alternatively, the user will be responsible of installing and calling the library before running artMS functions
+ Fix bug reporting the number of Intensity = 0

Changes in version 1.10.2 (2021-07-13)
+ Bug fix affecting {artmsAnalysisQuantifications()}
+ Allow {artmsAnalysisQuantifications()} to process previous versions of artMS
+ Change Extension of {artms_sessionInfo_quantification} file from {.txt} to {.log}
+ New parameters available in {artmsQuantification()}, including:
   - Parameter {printTables}. Default {TRUE}, prints tables. FALSE otherwise.
   - Parameter {return_results_object}. If TRUE, it returns a list of data frames with MSstats results. Default is FALSE
   - If both {printTables} and {printPDF} are FALSE, then {return_results_object} becames TRUE and a list of data frames is returned
+ Change default parameters of the configuration files: less verbose

Changes in version 1.10.1 (2021-06-30)
+ Addressing major changes in MSstats
   - R version larger than 4.1 is now required
   - Fractions: the option "Fractions" is removed from the configuration file. If fractions are present, the user must include a "Fraction" column in the keys.txt file, which artMS will detect automatically.
   - {artmsQualityControlEvidenceBasic}: fraction parameter no longer required (automatically detected from the keys file)
   - {keys.txt}: use {Fraction} instead of {FractionKey}
+ External packages used exclusively by the {artmsAnalysisQuantifications} function are not required. Those packages will have to be installed before running this function.
+ {artmsAvgIntensityRT}: argument {species} is not longer required
+ Example datasets: 
   - {artms_data_ph_evidence}: the size has been significantly reduced (bioconductor requirement). Only two biological replicates and 1/20 of the lines selected randomly. Including only 36 columns from the original evidence file
   - {artms_data_ph_msstats_results}: output from running {artmsQuantification} on the full version of the evidence file, including 4 biological replicates (instead of the reduced version available in the package)
   - {artms_data_ph_msstats_modelqc}: output from running {artmsQuantification} on the full version of the evidence file, including 4 biological replicates (instead of the reduced version available in the package)

Changes in version 1.10.0 (2021-05-12)
+ Bioconductor release 3.13
+ Several adjustments in {artmsAnalysisQuantifications} function:
   - Use NAs instead of 0 when reshaping the data for missing values ({-log2fc-wide.txt} and {-log2fc-long.txt} files)
   - {plotClusteringAnalysis} only available when 3 or more comparisons available in the configuration file
+ R > v4.0.0 is now required
+ Update documentation & vignette
+ Code cleaning

Changes in version 1.8.3 (2021-04-05)

Changes in version 1.8.2 (2021-03-18)
+ {artmsProtein2SiteConversion}: New PTM available as argument, a new user defined `PTM:XXX:yy`. Check documentation to find out more
+ QC plots: by default, all qc plots are now output to a folder directory, by type (qc-basic, qc-extended, qc_summary)
+ artMS working directory: artMS will create all the folders and subfolders relative to the working directory. No need to specify the full path to the working directory, but the user must set the working directory: setwd("/path/to/working/directory/")
+ Configuration file data object updates:
   + "output" the user can add a folder where would like to have the output results file. For example, "output: results_202003/example-results.txt" would create the "resutls_202003" folder (if it does not exist) with all the results files available there
   + "LFC" (log2fc) updated to range -0.58 to 0.58, i.e., a fold change larger than a 1.5 (instead of 2 as before)
+ Update and improve documentation and vignette
+ Several bug fixes

Changes in version 1.0.14 (2019-04-22)
+ Update artmsProtein2SiteConversion: it runs as default the "Leading razor protein".
+ Update vignette

+ Important artmsProtein2SiteConversion update: the protein column id to be 
converted to the 'site/peptide specific' notation (i.e. ProteinID_AAnumber) 
can be now selected by the user. This is important because if the user decides 
to remove the protein groups, the 'leading razor protein' is chosen as the 
main protein id column, therefore the user would have to choose that 
protein when converting the file.
