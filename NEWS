Changes in version v1.1.15 (2019-04-24)

+ artMS detects RefSeq IDs. It does not support yet enrichments and annotations
+ Update artmsAnalysisQuantifications to adjust for previous changes in PTMs: it better handles 'protein groups'
+ Doesn't remove outliers

Changes in version v1.1.14 (2019-04-22)

+ Update artmsProtein2SiteConversion: it runs as default the "Leading razor 
protein".
+ Update vignette

Changes in version v1.1.13 (2019-04-20)

+ Important artmsProtein2SiteConversion update: the protein column id to be 
converted to the 'site/peptide specific' notation (i.e. ProteinID_AAnumber) 
can be now selected by the user.
This is important because if the user decides to remove the protein groups,
the 'leading razor protein' is chosen as the main protein id column, therefore
the user would have to choose that protein when converting the file.

+ artmsQuantification is now able to process full uniprot ids 
(sp|ENTRY|ENTRY_NAME ...): it detects and extracts the ENTRY id

+ Depracated: artmsReplicatePlots


Changes in version v1.1.12 (2019-04-07)

+ Fix: filtering by group uses the Leading Razor Protein when the filter
"protein_groups: remove" is selected
+ Fix: `plotSP` of `artmsQualityControlEvidenceExtended` fails with old versions
of MaxQuant
+ artmsProtein2SiteConversion also processes RefSeq annotations

Changes in version v1.1.11 (2019-03-25)

+ Fix: column namne MS/MS count for old versions of MaxQuant

Changes in version v1.1.10 (2019-02-22)

+ Fix: final fix of build problems
¡
Changes in version v1.1.9 (2019-02-21)

+ Fix: build problem

Changes in version v1.1.8 (2019-02-18)

+ Fix: Remove abundance files to prevent users' confusions
+ Fix: use "Leading Razor Protein" as main protein ID

Changes in version v1.1.7 (2019-02-18)

annotation packages.
+ Improve messages to the user
